    default `gitignore' file. Thanks to Mark Rickert for the patch (pull
    request #150).

    BridgeSupport files were being searched in the wrong location.

= RubyMotion 2.21 =

  * Added reference zeroing to `WeakRef' starting from iOS 5 and OS X 10.7. It
    will now raise an exception in case a message is sent after the reference
    has been deallocated. Use the `WeakRef#weakref_alive?' method to check if
    it has been deallocated or not.
  * Improved performance where Array elements would be converted from Ruby to
    Objective-C instance. ~10% faster.

    IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET option instead of MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.
  * Fixed a memory leak where the objects with a cyclic reference would not
    be released when used inside an asynchronous Dispatch::Queue.
  * Fixed a bug where BridgeSupport files for external projects included via

    `rake clean'.

= RubyMotion 2.20 =

  * Improved command-line interface, e.g. `$ motion create --help' will now no
    longer create an application called ‘--help’. This deprecates the interface
    for any command plugins and this will fully be removed with RubyMotion v3.
  * Added support for loading plugins through RubyGems. Libraries that used to
    use `~/Library/RubyMotion' to load commands and/or templates should no
    longer do so, but instead add a `lib/motion_plugin.rb' file (see Joybox for
    an example). The `~/Library/RubyMotion' is from now on only meant for local
    usage, i.e. outside of the scope of a gem.

    the `:cflags` option.
  * [iOS] Made the UI test helper search for views from the `keyWindow' instead
    of the `current' window that was created specifically for the test. This
    makes it easier to interact with modal views such as `UIAlertView'.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in the build system where a link error would be caused
    when building for arm64 with Xcode 5.1. Thanks to Andrew Larssen for the
    patch (pull request #146).
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug where an NSDate object convered to a Time object would
    cause a calculation error.
  * [OSX] Fixed the `rake crashlog' task.
  * [OSX] Added `external_frameworks' config variable, which is used for
    frameworks that are outside of `/System/Library/Frameworks`, but are not
    meant to be embedded inside the application.
    E.g. `/Library/Frameworks/iTunesLibrary.framework'.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug where method types of NSOpenPanel and NSSavePanel were
    not being cached for their private counterparts that are substituted at
    runtime in case the application is running in a sandbox.

= RubyMotion 2.19 =

  * [iOS] Fixed a regression related to the sim launcher changes for Xcode 5.1

    (Ex. Array#sort{|a,b| return float_object }). 2 times faster.

= RubyMotion 2.18 =

  * Added the `rake crashlog:device' task which will download crash reports
    generated by the app on the device, symbolicate them and save them on the
    local file system. The latest generated file will then be automatically
    opened in Console.app.
  * Improved the terminal output when using `vendor_project` with an Xcode
    project so that it matches the build system output. This feature is using
    the XCPretty project. Thanks a lot to Marin Usalj and Delisa Mason for it.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where applications could not be launched on the simulator
    when using Xcode 5.1. Due to this change, Xcode 4 is no longer supported.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug where apps generated on i5/i7 machines would fail to run
    on older machines (ex. core2) due to the use of a new instruction.
  * Fixed a bug where Hash#{[]=, clear, removeObjectForKey} will immediately
    release an object.
  * Fixed a bug where Array#{delete, clear} will immediately release an object.
  * Fixed a bug where Struct#[]= and setter of Struct member will immediately
    release an object.
  * Fixed a bug where setter of Boxed member will immediately release an object.
  * Fixed a bug where Kernel#instance_variable_set will immediately release an
    object.
  * Fixed a bug in the cycle detector where weak Proc objects would have their
    `self' reference scanned, resulting in a double-release crash at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug where Kernel#block_given? would not work as expected if a Proc
    object was passed as a method argument.
  * Fixed a bug in the spec runner app that could cause the test suite to be

  * Improved the build system to compile as many spec files in parallel as
    possible.

= RubyMotion 2.17 =

  * Added the `Proc#weak!' method which transforms the strong reference to the
    block `self' variable into a weak reference. Once the `self' variable is
    weakly referenced there is no coming back to a strong reference. This
    method can be used to break cyclic references that the cycle detector is
    not able to handle yet.
  * Defined implementations of NSObject methods, such as `conformsToProtocol:',
    that take Ruby semantics into account on all classes created by RubyMotion.
  * Fixed a bug in compiler where boxed types would not be properly registered
    if a structure was only used for a pointer.
  * Fixed the dispatcher to let methods expecting a structure of type A accept
    a structure of type B who has the exact same fields signature, as in C
    (ex. MKCoordinateRegion and CGRect).
  * Added support for dynamic name directory in project templates. Thanks to
    Toshiwo for the patch (pull request #144).

    an empty Array object in certain cases.
  * Fixed a bug where NSDate objects would be wrongly converted to Time objects.
  * Fixed a bug where certain structures of the same signatures could not be
    used. (Ex. NSRect and CGRect in a 64-bit OS X app)
  * Improved Range.new performance. 20% faster.
  * Improved Array performance where finalizes object and expands internal
    memory. 15% faster.
  * Fixed bugs where ARC's rules related to method names starting with `new` or
    containing `copy` or `Copy` where not being followed. This lead to objects
    returned from Objective-C methods that matched these rules not being
    autoreleased and objects returned from Ruby to Objective-C not being
    retained.
  * Fixed the runtime to prefix certain kernel symbols we export (ex. selCopy)
    in order to avoid clashes at link time with certain 3rd-party libraries.
  * Fixed a bug in in the build system where duplicated entries in the
    app.resource_dirs array would mess up the resource-copying process.
  * Fixed a bug where nested WeakRef objects (WeakRef.new(WeakRef.new(...)))
    would not be properly resolved at dispatch time.
  * Fixed a bug in {NSObject,Boxed}#== with a WeakRef object operand where said
    operand would not be resolved.
  * Fixed a compiler bug where `not precompiled' errors when it uses structure
    of GLKit framework.
  * [iOS] Fix various bugs in the UI test helpers, like `tap`.
  * [OSX] Fixed #eval to honor the self binding when evaluating the string.
  * [OSX] Introduced the `app.codesign_for_release' variable, which controls
    whether code-signing should occur during `rake build:release'. The default
    value for this variable is `true'.

= RubyMotion 2.16 =

  * Fixed a heap overflow in floating point parsing (CVE-2013-4164).
  * Improved Time#{<, >, ==, eql?} performance. 9 times faster.
  * Improved the performance when NSDate objects are converted to Time objects.
    10 times faster.
  * Fixed regression in the REPL that made it impossible to use block local
    variables.

= RubyMotion 2.15 =

  * Added support for Xcode 5.1 Developer Preview and iOS 7.1 Beta.
  * Improved REPL to recognize Simulator at any scale and orientation. The only
    unsupported variant at this time is a Simulator window with scroll bars.
  * Fixed REPL<->Simulator coordinate translation when run on a Retina Mac.
  * Fixed undefined behaviour in REPL such as local variables not being stored.
  * Improved dispatching of shortcut methods (ex foo= is shortcut of setFoo:).
    20 times faster.
  * Improved the performance where Fixnum and Float are returned. 20% faster.
  * Improved Array#concat performance. About 2 times faster.
  * Improved Array#reverse performance. 2 times faster.
  * Improved Array#reverse! performance. 8 times faster.
  * Improved Array#rotate performance. 5 times faster.
  * Improved Array#rotate! performance. 40 times faster.
  * Improved iterators performance (ex Array#{each, map}). 2-3 times faster.
  * Fixed a bug where Array#rotate! causes a crash in REPL.
  * Fixed a bug where the objects created by "CFxxxCreate(args)" are not
    released.
  * Fixed a bug in dispatcher where #super cannot look up the shortcut method.
    (ie #foo=)
  * Improve the precision of Float value.
  * Raise error if cleaning a build artefact fails.
  * [iOS] Fixed and optimized remote debugging (`rake device debug=1').
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where `rake device' would no longer print the application
    logs from the device.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug on OSX platform where compiler flags for iOS are passed
    when it generates bridgesupport file for vendor library.
  * [OSX] Added missing bridgesupport metadata for Carbon, OSServices and
    ApplicationServices frameworks.
  * [iOS] Deprecated optional block that can be passed to the `tests` method
    when making use of the view test helpers. This can be done with normal
    `before` filters.

= RubyMotion 2.14 =

  * Really fix the inline function problem described in the previous update.

= RubyMotion 2.13 =

  * Fixed a bug where the methods which are defined as inline functions in
    iOS/OSX framework are not working properly.
  * Fixed a bug where using the mouse-over functionality in the REPL would
    lead to an internal deadlock and hang the process.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where the result of evaluated expressions could be
    prematurely released before being sent back to the command-line.
  * [iOS] Work around an issue where Instruments.app wants an integer
    UIDeviceFamily value and App Launcher wants a string.
  * [iOS] Fixed a big where the running the REPL in 64-bit mode would result
    in an error related to the fact that the REPL library was i386-only.

= RubyMotion 2.12 =

  * Added support for OS X Mavericks (10.9). The toolchain is now fully usable
    on a Mavericks machine and can also be used to create Mavericks OS X apps.
  * Added `profile' rake tasks that launch builds through Instruments.app for
    iOS (both simulator and device) and OS X applications. Run a `rake clean'
    before using the task on an existing project.
  * [OSX] Added optional support for the #eval method. To enable it, you can
    set the `app.eval_support' variable to true (default is false). Support
    is currently experimental and will increase your application bundle size
    by about 28MB.
  * Fixed a internal memory leak in the Enumerator object.
  * Added support to compile the Objective-C source codes which uses Modules
    syntax in `app.vendor_project'.
  * Added a custom `gen_bridge_metadata' which enables recursive function
    pointer parsing to support Objective-C blocks that yield blocks.
  * Added support for functions/methods that return Objective-C blocks by
    wrapping those as Proc's.
  * Fixed a memory leak when ObjC #initXXX methods will return internal class
    object (ex NSMutableData#initWithLength, NSArray#initWithArray).
  * Fixed where #new method doesn't work for GLKKit structure.
    (ex GLKMatrix2.new, GLKVector2.new).
  * Fixed a bug in Array#sample where it would return duplicated elements when
    a value greater than self length was passed into argument.
  * Fixed a bug where `motion update' might cause an error when it displays the
    changelog on OSX 10.9.
  * Fixed a compiler bug where it causes a crash with `rake device' when it
    overrides the method which has structure as argument.
  * [iOS] Fixed a crash when using certain NSIndexPath objects (64-bit only).
  * [iOS] Fixed `rake debug=1` on OS X 10.9 not working.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in the build system where it would generate invalid
    values for the UIDeviceFamily key (was using strings instead of integers).

= RubyMotion 2.11 =

  * Added the `rake clean:all' task which deletes all build object files
    (ex. those in ~/Library/RubyMotion/build). We recommend using that task
    before building an App Store submission.
  * Added support for Xcode asset catalogs. This can be used to manage all your
    image assets in a visual way, including your application’s icons. You can
    create and edit a new catalog like so:
    $ mkdir resources/Images.xcassets && open -a Xcode resources/Image.xcassets
  * Fixed a long standing limitation in the compiler where overriding in Ruby
    an Objective-C method that accepts a C-level block was not possible.
  * Fixed a regression where `return' from a block would terminate the app.
  * Improve the build system to always copy embedded.mobileprovision. Thanks to
    Jan Brauer for the patch (pull request #121).
  * Fixed a bug where a boxed struct would incorrectly be interpreted as a
    object type, leading to the dispatcher not recognizing a signature.
  * Fixed a bug where compiled object files of a vendored project were not
    actually being cleaned when running `rake clean`.
  * Fixed a bug where defining a singleton method on an object inside a method
    with named parameters (Objective-C-style selector) would result in that
    method being defined in the runtime with a wrong selector.
  * Fixed a bug where Range objects created with non-literal begin/end points
    would never be released, and therefore leaking memory.
  * Added `context` method as `describe` alias in spec.  Thanks to Ryo Katsuma
    for the patch (pull request #134).
  * Fixed a small internal memory leak in the dispatcher when sending the
    #method_missing message.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where providing nil as the value of a C-level
    block argument would not actually pass NULL but an empty Block structure
    instead. Thanks to Ruben Fonseca for the detective work.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where device log is wrong filtered with `rake device'
    when performed day is 1-9.
  * [iOS] Added support to launch the app as 64-bit in simulator.
  * [iOS] Fixed where non-retina iPad simulator does not launch as default.
    Thanks to Fabio Kuhn for the patch (pull request #133).
  * [iOS] Fixed a regression where certain GameKit class properties could not
    be used (ex. GKMatchRequest#minPlayers).
  * [iOS] Fixed a link error where "ld: framework not found IOKit" is caused
    with iOS 7 SDK when it will run `rake device'.
  * [OSX] Fixed the wrong default settings of short cut key in menu. Thanks to
    Kazuhiro NISHIYAMA for the detective work.

= RubyMotion 2.10 =

  * Fixed a critical regression in the compiler where DWARF metadata would not
    be generated, causing .dSYM bundles to miss debugging symbols for Ruby
    code. The regression was introduced in 2.8. If you submitted apps built
    with 2.8 or 2.9 to Apple and need to symbolicate crash reports, you can
    rebuild them with 2.10 and use the new .dSYM bundle.
  * Fixed a bug where `motion changelog' does not work.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in 2.9 that could lead to a compiler crash
    when using the GLKit framework.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake device' where it could sometimes crashes when
    retrieving console logs.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the build would fail when generating
    BridgeSupport metadata if the Xcode path contained a space character.
    Thanks to Michal Jirku for the detective work.
  * Fixed a warning in the build system when creating a universal static
    archive for a vendored project.
  * [iOS] Fixed the build system to really not build for 64-bit by default.
  * [iOS] Fixed a regression where exceptions could be not rescued in GCD
    blocks on device, apparently due to an underlying change in iOS 7.
    Thanks to Mark Frawley for the detective work.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where `rake device' would cause an Assertion Failed when
    `app.name' contains non-ascii characters.

= RubyMotion 2.9 =

  * Work around what is very likely a bug in the App Store verification
    process which would reject RubyMotion apps based on the fact that certain
    __builtin__xxx_chk() functions of the C runtime are marked as private API.
    These functions are called by the compiler in certain scenarios in order
    to detect overflows. So far we know Apple rejects __strlcpy_chk() and
    __strlcat_chk() calls, so we removed them from the RubyMotion runtime.

= RubyMotion 2.8 =

  * Added support for iOS 7.0 GM and Xcode 5.0 GM.
  * Added support for building 64-bit iOS apps for iPhone 5S (experimental).
    The toolchain is now able to create x86_64 apps for the simulator and
    arm64 apps for the device. Given the fact that 64-bit iOS has just been
    announced and that many 3rd-party projects have not yet been updated, the
    support is disabled by default. To enable, you can edit your Rakefile and
    set the following lines: app.archs['iPhoneOS'] << 'arm64';
    app.archs['iPhoneSimulator'] << 'x86_64'
  * Improved the compiler to emit assembly instead of LLVM bitcode, which
    results in a significant performance improvement (~3x faster builds).
  * Upgraded the toolchain to LLVM 3.3 and to use clang compilers by default.
    Xcode 4 (llvm-gcc) is no longer required to exist in the file system.
  * Fixed a bug in build system where it could not build an app that was using
    Korean characters in the name.
  * Fixed a bug in the `motion update' command where a non-ASCII character was
    wrongly used in the source code, causing the process to fail in certain
    versions of Ruby. Thanks to Clay Allsopp for the patch (pull request #125).
  * Fixed the compiler to emit debugging (DWARF) annotations for expressions
    that weren't covered before (ex. variables assignments).
  * Fixed a bug where Time#{==, eql?} would return the wrong value when using
    duplicated object from #copy.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system in the `app.vendor_project' method where
    providing custom compiler flags (:cflags => '...') wouldn't work if the
    project was being built twice  (ex. `rake build' which builds for both the
    simulator and the device). Thanks to Nick Quaranto for finding the bug.
  * [iOS] Development builds for the device will now compile for the lowest
    architecture possible, in order to create faster builds.
  * [iOS] Fixed a malloc error bug when retrieving a NSDate object from the
    ABRecordCopyValue() function.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where methods of the ABPersonViewController,
    ABNewPersonViewController and ABUnknownPersonViewController would cause
    crashes in iOS 7.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where the platform/SDK key in Info.plist would indicate
    `iphoneos' even for simulator builds. It has now been changed to
    `iphonesimulator', like Xcode. Thanks to Hwee-Boon Yar for the patch
    (pull request #129).
  * Fixed a bug where template working trees would not be updated upon git pull
    with `motion create [AppName] -template=[git repository path]'.
    Thanks to Jamon Holmgren for the patch (pull request #128).

= RubyMotion 2.7 =

  * Added support for iOS 7.0 Beta 6 and Xcode 5.0 DP 6.
  * Bundler is now integrated in new iOS and OS X projects. A default Gemfile
    will be created and the Rakefile file will require and initialize the
    bundler gem. In case Bundler is not to be found in the Ruby distribution
    that is being used, the build system keeps working as usual.
  * Added the `--cache-version' flag to the `motion update' command which lets
    you keep multiple versions of RubyMotion in your computer. Cached versions
    are installed as `/Library/RubyMotion<XXX>' (where XXX is the version
    number). A project can use an older version of RubyMotion by changing its
    Rakefile to point to `/Library/RubyMotion<XXX>/lib'. The `--force-version'
    flag previously available in `motion update' has been removed.
  * Added the `motion device:console' command to print the logs of the USB
    connected device. New messages will be printed in real-time. Use ^C to
    disconnect from the device.
  * Added the `motion changelog' command to open the NEWS file in the terminal.
    Thanks to Dan Loewenherz for the patch (pull request #107).
  * Added the `String#to_fourcharcode' method which converts the receiver into
    a FourCharCode type (used when doing Carbon/AppleEvent programming). The
    receiver must have exactly 4 characters.
  * Added `*.gem' into .gitignore in gem template.
  * Removed calls from the String/Encoding/Regexp classes to ICU functions that
    Apple has marked as non-public API. As a result, certain operations on
    UTF-32 encodings are not possible anymore, until we figure out a solution.
  * Fixed a memory crasher in Range.new.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake crashlog' where it would fail with a missing
    Shellwords constant, and also when it was not able to locate any crash
    report file.
  * Fixed the wording of the message printed when an application terminates
    with a non-zero status code.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake spec' where it would always return exit(0) status.
  * Fixed the default value of app.short_version to be the same value as in
    app.version. Thanks to Justin Campbell for the patch (pull request #62).
  * Improved the `Boxed#to_a' to recursively send the `#to_a' message on fields
    of the Boxed class (ex: CGRectMake(1, 2, 3, 4).to_a #=> [[1, 2], [3, 4]]).
  * Improved Time class implementation in order to follow Ruby 1.9, so far it
    was based on a Ruby 1.8. This would handle a time that exceeds the value of
    the 32 bit. Added Time#{round, subsec, to_r} methods and changed Time#{new,
    localtime, getlocal} methods to allow the variable arguments.
  * Fixed a minor bug in the cycle detector where it would scan the instance
    variable slots of a pure-Ruby object that have not been initialized yet.
  * Fixed a memory crasher in the REPL that would happen when attempting to
    set the libedit prompt from another thread, leading to a race condition.
  * Fixed a bug, apparently caused by a change in the Objective-C runtime in
    Xcode 5, that would make certain methods (ex. MKAnnotationView#image) not
    returning a proper type at runtime but a pointer to a structure instead.
  * Fixed the build system to make the content of the ARR_CYCLES_DISABLE
    environment variable persistent when distributing an app.
  * [iOS] The `rake device' task will now start the application (without the
    need to attach a debugger). Logs emitted by the app will be redirected in
    the terminal. ^C quits the app. In order to just install the app, the
    `install_only' option can be given (ex. `rake device install_only=1').
  * [iOS] Fixed the REPL/mouse-over functionality when using the simulator in
    retina mode (which is the default when targetting iOS 7).
  * [iOS] Added experimental support for remote debugging with lldb (Xcode 5).
  * [iOS] Added support for the compilation of SpriteKit texture atlas files.
    The build system will now compile directories with the `.atlas' extension
    into one large file inside the app bundle, similar to how Xcode does it.
  * [iOS] Added `:light_content' as new possible value for the
    `app.status_bar_style' Rakefile variable. Thanks to Chris Radford for the
    patch (pull request #116).
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in `rake debug=1' with Xcode 5 where builtin commands
    (ex. `pro') where not available. We ported the commands from gdb to lldb.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where the Accelerate framework was not covered by the
    compiler. Note that the framework is C-only, might be tough to use from
    RubyMotion, and should probably be called in vendored-C code for better
    performance results.
  * [OSX] Added the `app.category' variable which can be used to specify the
    AppStore category. The default value is `utilities'. Thanks to Mark Rickert
    for the patch (pull request #115).
  * [OSX] Fixed the REPL/mouse-over functionality to be able to select views in
    the key window, if the application has multiple windows opened.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug in Dispatch.once where only the first occurence of the
    call in the code would work as expected.
  * [OSX] Added the `app.codesign_for_development' variable that can be set to
    true to enable codesigning for development builds. The default value for
    this variable is false, and only release builds are codesigned by default.

= RubyMotion 2.6 =

  * Added support for iOS 7.0 Beta 4 and Xcode 5.0 DP 4.
  * Improved the build system so that spec files are also compiled in parallel.
  * Fixed a bug in the cycle detector where it would try scanning objects that
    have already been released. Thanks to Nick Quaranto for the help.
  * Fixed a bug in the cycle detector where instance variables on scanned
    objects would disappear, because of a problem in the WeakRef class.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake crashlog' with application names containing space
    characters. Thanks to Clay Allsopp for the patch (pull request #112).
  * Fixed a bug in the debugger where the debugged process would be terminated
    if ^C was pressed while the app was running.
  * Fixed a bug in the spec framework where a spec that raises a pure
    NSException would cause a runtime error as it would try to send the
    #backtrace message to the object.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in the REPL (iOS 7 only) where local variables would not
    be preserved.

= RubyMotion 2.5 =

  * The runtime is now able to detect and break basic circular references
    (when two objects point to themselves). Only objects created from Ruby
    classes (including Objective-C subclasses) are scanned. Cycle detection
    happens when draining the nearest autorelease pool and has a limited number
    of depth iterations, to preserve acceptable runtime performance. To disable
    the cycle detector, set the ARR_CYCLES_DISABLE environment variable to any
    value. To enable debug logging, set the ARR_CYCLES_DEBUG environment
    variable to any value. Many thanks to Joe Noon for pre-testing this feature.
  * Fixed a bug where C-level blocks allocated by the compiler would never be
    released at runtime, as well as the Proc object linked to it. C-level
    blocks are now allocated on the stack, keep a weak-reference to the
    Proc object, and properly implement the Blocks ABI copy/dispose handlers
    to retain/release the associated Proc object when required.
  * The Exception class is now rewritten on top of the NSException class,
    and properly implements its primitive methods. Exceptions are no longer
    being converted. Exception handlers written in Ruby will still catch
    NSException objects by default.
  * Fixed memory leaks in NSMutableArray#{first(n), last(n), pop(n), shift(n)}.
  * Fixed a bug where nested block variables would not be properly synchronized
    if the block terminated early with the `break' or the `return' construct.
    Thanks to Greg Fodor for the report.
  * Fixed a bug where local variables created inside a loop (ex. `while') and
    used inside a nested block would cause the previous value to be released
    twice during the next iteration. Thanks to Daniel Dickison for the report.
  * Fixed Dispatch::*.{sync,async} methods to not catch exceptions inside the
    given blocks, and simply let the process crash naturally.
  * Fixed the build system to not compile default exception handlers in the
    main() entry-point function, as we want the process to crash naturally.
  * Fixed a bug where block variables passed to Dispatch::Queue#async could
    be released twice, leading to a crash.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where app.deployment_target and
    app.sdk_version were compared as text. Thanks to Andrew Babichev for the
    patch (pull request #108).
  * Changed the `rake simulator' task to print a message when an application
    crashes due to a signal (ex. SIGSEGV) and suggest the user to read the
    crash report file that has been generated by the system.
  * Added the `rake crashlog' task to automatically open the latest crash
    report file that was generated by the system for the current app.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where using the <tab> key to enable auto-completion
    could result in a crash due to a missing symbol.
  * Fixed a bug where an object implementing the NSCoding protocol as well as
    #init and #initialize(arg) methods would cause a crash during creation.
  * [iOS] Fixed a warning message from the linker that would be displayed when
    using Xcode 5 to build the app.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in the debugger where built-in debug commands weren't
    installed within the simulator.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in the build system where an app cmpiled for iOS 5.x
    would immediately crash on the device.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where the NSUIntegerMax constant was not properly
    exposed when targeting iOS 7.x.

= RubyMotion 2.4 =

  * Added support for iOS 7.0 Beta 3 and Xcode 5.0 DP 3.
  * Fixed a long-standing set of memory-related bugs related to lambdas.
    Dynamic variables (shared by lambdas and calling scope) are now allocated
    as heap memory inside the Proc data structure. Local variables are properly
    synchronized. Proc objects are properly reclaimed by the system once they
    are no longer used. Changes have been added to both the compiler and the
    runtime.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug in `rake device' where it could not build an app using
    Xcode 5.x with a deployment target less than iOS 7.0.
  * [iOS] Reduced the size of the Default-568h@2x.png file. Thanks to Gant
    Laborde for the patch (pull request #100).
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where `rake retina=3.5' would not work with Xcode 5.x.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where `rake simulator' would re-launch an iOS 7 simulator
    with Xcode 5.x every time.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug in the build system where APIs of 3rd-party libraries
    would not be properly handled in 64-bit mode.
  * Fixed a memory crasher when trying to use the old value of an instance
    variable slot as a local variable.
  * Fixed memory leaks in NSMutableArray#insert.
  * Fixed memory leaks when parsing bridgesupport file during compilation.
  * Fixed a bug in NSMutableDictionary#delete where it will cause a crash if it
    would use the result of NSMutableDictionary#delete on the receiver object
    which was created by NSJSONReadingMutableContainers.
  * Fixed a bug where 3rd-party libraries would fail to build if the file path
    of the app contained space characters.
  * Fixed a bug in Kernel#Array() where it would return an incorrected value
    if an NSArray object was passed as argument.
  * Fixed a compiler bug where `not precompiled' errors would sometimes happen
    at runtime when using APIs dealing with BOOL types.
  * Added a block to setup controller in the spec API. Thanks to Katsuyoshi Ito
    for the patch (pull request #104).
  * Fixed the `rake build' task to honor the `keep_temps' environment variable.
    If set, temporary files (such as LLVM bitcode and assembly) will not be
    removed from the build directory. To be used for debugging only.

= RubyMotion 2.3 =

  * Added support for iOS 7.0 Beta 2 and Xcode 5.0 DP 2.
  * Fixed a bug where the `RUBYMOTION_ENV' constant would not be defined before
    executing the main scope of .rb application files, resulting in a const
    lookup error in case the constant was trying to be accessed within a file
    or module scope.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where `rake simulator' would open 2 simulator apps at
    the same time, due to the fact that the application name changed between
    Xcode 4.x and Xcode 5.
  * [iOS] Fixed a bug where certain NSObject methods would be missing in the
    Foundation framework compiler file.
  * [iOS] Fixed a warning message from the linker that would be displayed when
    building for iOS 7.0.
  * Fixed a bug in defined?(super) where it would return an incorrect value
    when used from an included module.
  * Improve string interpolation performance. 40% faster.
  * Improve String#delete performance. 5 times faster.
  * Improve Objective-C methods performance in String object. 50% faster.
  * Added `output=colorized' in `rake spec'.
  * Added `skip_build' option to `rake simulator' (iOS) and `rake run' (OSX) to
    to run the program without recompiling (ex. `rake skip_build=1').
  * Added git repository support for templates. (ex. `motion create
    --template=https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/smart-ios.git test').
    Thanks to Gant Laborde and Matt Garrison for the patch (pull request #92).
  * Fixed a build error that was happening with Xcode 3.
    Thanks to Matt Garriott for the patch (pull request #97).
  * Added callback after created controller in spec. Thanks to Katsuyoshi Ito
    for the patch (pull request #96).
  * Fixed the build system to set `spec_mode' before running the `setup' block
    in Rakefile. Thanks to Clay Allsopp for the patch (pull request #84).
  * Added the `app.exclude_from_detect_dependencies' Rakefile variable. Thanks
    to Clay Allsopp for the patch (pull request #81).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where it would remove `.nib' ressource
    files even corresponding `.xib' files did not exist. Thanks to Kristian for
    the patch (pull request #98).
  * Added back `motion ri' support, which was incidentally removed due to a
    mistake on the build machine.

= RubyMotion 2.2 =

  * Added iOS 7.0 and OS X 10.9 support. Xcode 5.0 DP must be installed and
    activated as the default (using `xcode-select'). Xcode 4.x must remain in
    /Applications/Xcode.app as RubyMotion will still be using it, until we
    properly migrate to the new compilers. You can revert to Xcode 4.x (using
    `xcode-select') for stable development. *WARNING* iOS 7.0 and OS X 10.9
    are Apple confidental and cannot be discussed online. Do not post code
    using the new APIs online.

= RubyMotion 2.1 =

  * Improved the `rake simulator' (iOS) and `rake run' (OSX) tasks to honor the
    `args' environment variable, which can be used to provide command-line
    arguments that will be passed to the app executable when launching.
    (ex. rake simulator args="-com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1").
  * [iOS] Improved `rake archive' to generate a `manifest.plist' file that can
    be used for Ad-Hoc distribution. Added the `app.manifest_assets' Rakefile
    variable which can be set to an array of hashes describing the assets to be
    included in the file. The default is an empty array, and no file is then
    generated. (ex. app.manifest_assets << { :kind => 'software-package',
    :url => 'http://hipbyte.com/foo.ipa' }).
  * [iOS] Fixed `rake simulator' to show a warning message in case the user is
    running tmux without `reattach-to-user-namespace', which is necessary.
  * [iOS] Fixed compilation issues with 6.0 SDK.
  * [OSX] Fixed a bug in `rake debug=1' where the debugger would not properly
    start in case the application name includes a space character.
  * [OSX] Added `rake ctags' task to generate `tags' file.
  * [OSX] Added `rake static' task to create a static .a archive file.
  * [OSX] Added `rake build' task as a shortcut for both `build:development'
    and `build:release'.
  * [OSX] Fixed `rake archive' to honor the content of the `app.entitlements'
    project variable when code-signing the binary.
  * [OSX] Added the `app.embedded_frameworks' Rakefile variable that can
    include paths to 3rd-party frameworks that should be copied in the app
    bundle's 'Frameworks' directory (ex. app.embedded_frameworks +=
    ['~/src/MyFramework.framework']). The build system will also fix the
    install name of the executable. The default value is an empty array.
  * [OSX] Fixed `rake archive:distribution' to properly codesign the app
    executable twice, necessary for App Store submissions.
  * [OSX] Fixed the Info.plist file generation to include the minimum OS
    requirement key, necessary for App Store submissions.
  * Fixed a bug in `Dispatch.once' where it would sometimes not yield the block.
  * Fixed the require statement in the `gem' template Rakefile. Thanks to
    Devon Blandin for the patch (pull request #88).
  * Fixed the `iOS' template warning message to print the right library path.
    Thanks to Tom Milewski for the patch (pull request #86).
  * Fixed a bug in `app.files_dependencies' where it would not allow a path
    containing "../" (ex. app.files_dependencies 'foo.rb' => '../bar.rb').
    Thanks to Jeremy Ruppel for the patch (pull request #90).
  * Fixed a bug in `app.vendor_project' to properly set the
    CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR variable for non-standard Xcode projects. Thanks to
    Jack Chen for the patch (pull request #94).
  * Fixed `app.vendor_project' with Xcode projects to rebuild the project in
    case a file changed. Thanks for Jack Chen for the idea and initial work.
  * Fixed a bug where the .gitignore file would not be generated anymore when
    creating a new project.
  * Added the .gitignore file into the `gem' template.
  * Added the BasicObject#__id__ method for CRuby compatibility.
  * Fixed a bug in `undef' and Module#remove_method where it would raise an
    'undefined method' error if the method was called before being removing.
  * Fixed a memory bug where an object would be prematurely released if an
    #initXXX method was called right from within #initialize.
  * Fixed a bug in #respond_to? where WeakRef objects would not be properly
    handled.
  * Fixed a bug in detecting file dependencies where it will not detect file
    dependencies if the files contain nested constants.

= RubyMotion 2.0 =

  * Added OSX development support. Use `motion create --template=osx' to create
    an OSX project. Use `rake -T' inside to see the available tasks and
    `rake config' to see the application config variables. RubyMotion OSX apps
    are built for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and can support OSX v10.7
    and v10.8 as deployment targets. Check out the HipByte/RubyMotionSamples
    repository on GitHub for sample code and the devcenter for documentation.
  * Added command-line plugin system, which lets developers extend the
    `/usr/bin/motion' command-line tool with new commands (ex. `motion foo').
    Builtin commands have been extracted as plugins and 3rd-party plugins can
    be created inside the `~/Library/RubyMotion/command' directory.
  * Added a RubyMotion gem project template. Use `motion create --template=gem'
    to create one and check `rake -T' inside to see the available tasks.
  * Added project templates system (usage: `motion create --template=xxx').
    RubyMotion comes with 3 templates: `ios' (default), `osx' and `gem'.
    3rd-party project templates can be created inside the
    `~/Library/RubyMotion/template' directory.
  * Deprecated `require "motion/project"' in project Rakefiles. Existing iOS
    projects should now require `motion/project/template/ios' instead. We
    preserve compatibility for now but please do migrate.
  * Added the `motion account' command to open the license account page.
  * Added the `WeakRef' class to create weak references. Usage is
    `WeakRef.new(obj)' and follows CRuby's WeakRef stdlib class. Passed
    references will not be retained. Use with caution as sending a message
    to a WeakRef object whose reference has been prematurely collected will
    cause a runtime crash. The `WeakRef' class will be replaced by a no-op
    once the runtime is able to deal with cyclic references.
  * Improved the detection of file dependencies to handle absolute paths.
    Thanks to Clay Allsopp for the patch (pull request #82).
  * Improved the build system by using a separate build directory for source
    files that resides outside of the project (ex. gems) in order to reduce
    the compilation time.
  * Fixed a bug where a crash would happen when calling a method defined using
    #define_method that was contained in an extended module or in an inherited
    class that includes a module.
  * Fixed a bug where a crash would happen when trying to override the
    `drawMapRect:zoomScale:inContext:' method in a MKOverlayView subclass.
  * Improve `rake spec' to display an error message if there are no spec files
    in the `spec' project directory.
  * Fixed a bug where trying to set a constant inside another constant that is
    not a Module object would not raise an exception (ex. `A=42; A::B=42').
  * Fixed a bug where Module#include? would not be raising an exception if the
    receiver was not a Module object.
  * Fixed a bug where `return' on a yielded block that used `ensure' would not
    work.
  * Fixed a bug where `catch' and `throw' would not work on an iOS device.
  * Fixed a bug where a crash would happen when using a variadic method from
    the Cocos2D framework.
  * Fixed a bug where a memory leak would happen when creating an object and
    passing an arbitrary expression to the initializer method.
  * Fixed a bug in build system where a "stack level too deep" exception could
    happen.
  * Fixed a bug when detecting file dependencies where classes or modules
    defined using the `XXX::YYY' syntax could not be properly parsed.
  * Fixed a limitation in Struct where creating a struct with more than 10
    fields was not possible. We moved the limit to 100 fields.
  * Fixed a limitation in the dispatcher where dynamically sending a message
    or yielding a block with more than 10 arguments was not possible. We moved
    the limit to 100 arguments.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where it would get corrupted when receiving too
    much input from the evaluator (ex. when using auto-completion).
  * Fixed a bug where a compilation error would happen when parsing a
    BridgeSupport structure that included a very large field.
  * Improved the `motion ri' command to honor the $PAGER environment variable.
  * Improved the `app.vendor_project' method to honor the :bridgesupport_cflags
    and :bridgesupport_exceptions options, which will be appropriately passed
    to the BridgeSupport generator. Thanks to Juan Karam for the patch.
  * RubyMotion is one year old! Thanks all for your support.

= RubyMotion 1.35 =

  * Added support for string constants defined in 3rd-party header files using
    the macro system (ex. #define MyConstant @"SomeValue").
  * Added the `no_start' option to `rake device debug=1' to let the user attach
    a custom debugger. This is for the RubyMine integration.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where the history could not be saved if it included
    UTF-8 characters.
  * Fixed a caching bug in Object#respond_to? which could return true for a
    method that did not exist.
  * Fixed a bug in REPL where an error message was often printed after using the
    `quit' or `exit' command.
  * Fixed a bug where the AVPlayer#currentTime method caused a `{?=qiIq}@:' not
    precompiled' error.
  * Improved `rake spec' error messages to include more details. Thanks to
    Steven Webb for the patch (pull request #68).
  * Improved `rake spec files=...' to make the `_spec' suffix optional. Thanks
    to Dave Lee for the patch (pull request #71).
  * Fixed a bug where using the AudioQueueBuffer structure would cause a crash.
  * Added the `:force_load' option for the `app.vendor_project' Rakefile method.
    This flag has a default value of `true' and can be set of `false' when
    vendoring 3rd-party libraries that include duplicated symbols.
  * Added the Dir#to_path method for CRuby compatibility.
  * Fixed a bug where calling #alias on a new method would cause a crash.
  * Fixed a bug where defining a method with #define_method on a module then
    messaging the method would cause a crash.
  * Fixed a bug where 'rake device debug=1' would cause a crash if the project
    name included UTF-8 characters.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where framework dependencies would not
    properly be loaded.
  * Fixed a rare bug in the `super' dispatcher.

= RubyMotion 1.34 =

  * Fixed a regression where command + mouse-over would not work in the
    simulator window.
  * Fixed a regression in the build system where updated resource files would
    not be copied.

= RubyMotion 1.33 =

  * Fixed a bug where certain Float object would be losing 2-bits of precision.
    This was happening because the compiler optimized floats to fit in a 30-bit
    data structure. The runtime will now allocate 32-bit floats on the heap
    when they cannot be accurately stored as 30-bit.
  * Added a feature to support multiple resource directories. Introduced the
    `app.resources_dirs' variable which defaults to `['./resources']' and can
    be modified to specify another resource directory to the build system. The
    previous `app.resources_dir' variable is now deprecated.
  * Added a feature to automatically create the `Default-568h@2x.png' file in
    the resources directory during `motion create', in order to support 4-inch
    screens.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where apps whose names include an UTF-8 or
    UTF8-MAC character would not compile.
  * Fixed a bug in the simulator mouse-over which could not properly select
    views if the iOS simulator was rotated.
  * Fixed a bug where the iOS simulator would not launch on OSX 10.6.
  * Fixed a bug in `NSDate.alloc.init.timeIntervalSince1970' which would cause
    a malloc_error_break error.
  * Fixed memory leaks in NSDate.new and NSDate.alloc.init.
  * Fixed a bug in Dir.entries and Dir.foreach where an exception was always
    raised.
  * Added the NSData#to_s method which is alias for NSData#to_str.
  * Fixed a bug in Hash#delete where the deleted object would be prematurely
    released by the table.
  * Fixed a bug where the iOS simulator would not launch if `app.xcode_dir'
    pointed to a path other than the '/Applications' folder.
  * Fixed a bug where the iOS simulator would be relaunched every time with
    `rake' command.

= RubyMotion 1.32 =

  * Added support for Xcode 4.6 and iOS 6.1 SDK.
  * Improved Array#hash performance.
  * Fixed a bug in IO#closed? and File#closed? where an exception wasn't raised
    if the receiver wasn't initialized.
  * Fixed a bug in IO#gets where a memory heap overrun would be triggered.
  * Fixed a bug in IO#close where it would close the wrong stream when opened
    in both read/write mode by IO#open.

= RubyMotion 1.31 =

  * Fixed a bug in Kernel.sprintf and NSDate.new which would cause a
    malloc_error_break error.
  * Added .sass-cache, .idea and app/pixate_code.rb to the default .gitignore
    file.
  * Fixed memory leaks in Complex and Rational classes.
  * Improved String#{[]=, index} performance when a String object has only
    ASCII code range characters. 5-14 times faster.
  * Improved String#{==, eql?} performance when the length of the strings do
    not match. 15 times faster.
  * Improved String#+ performance by pre-allocating heap memory.
  * Fixed a bug in MatchData where it caused a crash due to an assertion when
    used on an uninitialized MatchData object.
  * Fixex a bug in the automatic dependencies checker where it would cause a
    build error when `app.files' contained a non-flat Array.
  * Improved the automatic dependencies checker in the build system to be way
    faster. Thanks to Yury Korolev for the patch.
  * Fixed a memory crasher that would happen when symbolicating large exception
    backtraces (simulator only). Thanks to Doug Puchalski for the help.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake spec' where an ArgumentError exception would be raised
    when `it' clauses in spec files would not be defined with a block.
  * Improved the `tap' format of `rake spec' to print the number of each test
    instead of the total number, and also a better description.

= RubyMotion 1.30 =

  * Fixed a bug in the build system where it could not detect file dependencies
    using nested classes (ex. `module M; class C' and `class C2 < M::C').
  * Fixed a bug where MapKit annotation pins would disappear, because certain
    Ruby objects (in this case, MKAnnotations) would use a Bignum value as the
    return value of the `hash' method, which would not work properly when used
    within MapKit.
  * Added formatter for RubyMine tests runner. Thanks to Dennis Ushakov for the
    patch.
  * Fixed a bug in Float#hash where (-0.0).hash returned a different value with
    (0.0).hash.
  * Fixed a bug in Float#** and Fixnum#** which would return a Complex object
    when the receiver was a negative value.
  * Fixed a bug in Float#round which would return an inaccurate value.
  * Fixed a bug in Numeric#div which would not call the super `floor' method.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#step where it would return an object of the wrong type
    when a float value was given as range.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#{inspect, eql?, ==, hash} where crashes would happen
    when using cyclic range objects.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#each where it would not work if the receiver was
    created using #to_str for the beginning of the range.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#first(n) where it returned (n + 1) elements.
  * Added the Object#singleton_class method.
  * Fixed a bug in String#upto where it did not return an Enumerator object
    when a block was not given.
  * Fixed a bug in MatchData#[] where it would return a wrong value when a
    negative Fixnum object was passed as the index.
  * Fixed a bug in Regexp#options where it was returning a wrong value.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#{min, max} where it would not evaluate the block.
  * Fixed a bug in {File::Stat, Dir, StructClass}.new where it was crashing.
  * Fixed memory leaks in the following classes: Boxed classes (ex. `CGRect'),
    Pointer, Range and Time.
  * Fixed memory leaks where the following methods would return an object that
    would be leaking: Object#{dup, clone}, Time#{gm, getgm} Time._load,
    Object#enum_for, NSDictionary#{inspect, dup, to_a, keys, values, value_at,
    select, reject, merge}, NSMutableDictionary#{delete_if, select!},
    NSArray#{dup, inspect, [], select, values_at, +, *},
    NSMutableArray#{select!, uniq!}, Pointer.magic_cookie, Boxed#dup.
  * Fixed memory leaks where some internal data in following classes and
    methods would be leaking: Bignum, Random, Symbol, File::Stat, StructClass,
    Dispatch::Queue, Marshal.{dump, load}, Kernel.sprintf, Regexp.{new, quote},
    Hash.new, String#{split, count, delete, tr, tr!, tr_s, tr_s!}, Array#hash,
    Symbol#inspect.

= RubyMotion 1.29 =

  * Fixed a loading error with the ripper library when using Ruby 1.8.
  * Fixed a bug where the files that only contained constants were not detected
    by the file dependencies system.
  * Fixed a bug where cyclic file dependencies would cause a `stack level too
    deep' error.
  * Fixed a bug where detecting file dependencies would cause a build error
    when the list of files would not be given as a flat array.

= RubyMotion 1.28 =

  * Added the `motion ri' command to access to API information on command line.
    Ex: motion ri Dispatch::Queue#sync
  * Improved the build system to detect file dependencies automatically.
    This feature is experimental, if you encounter any problem you can disable
    it by setting `app.detect_dependencies = false' in the Rakefile.
  * Fixed the build system to set a 5 seconds timeout when accessing the
    software updates server. Thanks Nick Quaranto for the patch.
  * Improved `rake simulator' to honor the SIM_STDOUT_PATH, SIM_STDERR_PATH
    and SIM_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER environment variables, to respectively set the
    path of the stdout and stderr streams and to tell the simulator launcher
    that it should wait for a debugger before starting the application. These
    variables will be used in the RubyMine integration.
  * Fixed a bug in Dispatch::Object#dispatch_object on iOS versions below 6.0
  * Fixed a bug in NSDictionary#select which always raised an exception.
  * Fixed a bug in String#<< which raised an ArgumentError exception instead of
    RangeError if the given object was is out of range.
  * Fixed a bug in Kernel.catch when no argument was given.
  * Fixed a bug in Kernel.Rational which was not raising a TypeError exception
    if a Symbol object was passed.
  * Fixed a bug in Symbol#clone and Sybmol#dup which didn't raised TypeError
    exceptions.
  * Fixed a bug in Symbol#match and Symbol#=~ which did not properly return
    an index of the beginning match.
  * Fixed a bug in Symbol#succ and Symbol#next which returned a String object.
  * Added the following methods: Complex#rationalize, ENV#select! and
    ENV#keep_if.
  * Fixed a bug in Complex#/ which raised an exception when passed 0.0.
  * Fixed a bug in Complex.rect and Complex.polar which raised an ArgumentError
    exception instead of TypeError when a wrong value was given.
  * Fixed a bug in Regexp.last_match which raised an IndexError exception when
    an index out of the matched range was given.
  * Fixed a bug in ENV#[]= which did not raise an Errno::EINVAL exception if
    the given String object included the '=' character.
  * Fixed an error message in `rake target' when it cannot find iOS simulator.
  * Fixed a bug when using TWTweetComposeViewController's methods on iOS 6.0
    below would trigger a crash at runtime.

= RubyMotion 1.27 =

  * Fixed a bug where NSDecimalNumber.decimalNumberWithDecimal would not work
    since 1.24 in development mode, because of a regression introduced after
    changing the default set of optimization passes.
  * Fixed a bug where the `dispatch_object' method would not return a proper
    value on iOS 6.0, because it wasn't conforming to the new os/object.h
    structure.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake spec' where certain UIAutomation-based methods would
    not be callable because of a regression introduced in the previous update.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler to compile references to C functions using the
    weak linkage. If the symbol of a C function is not available at runtime,
    the function will not be defined and respond_to? will return false.
    This fixes applications linking against AddressBook.framework on 6.0 and
    making conditional use of the new ABAddressBookCreateWithOptions().
  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where calling `super' in certain methods
    (ex. UISlider's thumbRectForBounds:trackRect:value:) would crash the
    program due to an assertion.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where certain structures could be returned as
    an object of the wrong class (ex. MKCoordinateRegion.region returning
    AudioValueRange instead of CLLocationCoordinate2D).
  * Fixed a bug in Object#{dup,clone} where #{initialize_dup,initialize_clone}
    would not be called.
  * Fixed a bug in Object#instance_eval where the receiver object was not
    properly yield to the block.
  * Fixed a bug in Array#== and Marshal.dump where unnecessary private methods
    were being looked up.
  * Fixed a bug in Array#{rotate,rotate!} where it would not raise a TypeError
    exception if nil was given.
  * Fixed Array#{uniq, uniq!} and NSArray#{uniq, uniq!} to support blocks.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#dup where the begin/end values were not copied.
  * Fixed a bug in Range#step which would not behave like Numeric#step if given
    a Float argument.
  * Fixed a bug in String#<< with a codepoint argument where an exception would
    be raised when called on US-ASCII/BINARY strings.
  * Added .DS_Store, temporary files and project files into the default
    .gitignore file. Thanks to Mark Rickert and Eric Summers for the patch.

= RubyMotion 1.26 =

  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the Info.plist file would not be
    generated with the right DT* values when targetting iOS 6.0. This fixes
    AppStore submissions for apps made for the iPhone 5 new retina format.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system when building .bridgesupport files where
    it would fail to process header paths including space characters.
  * Fixed a bug where the `rake static' task would not work with iOS 6.0.
  * Fixed a compiler bug when using the
    `TWTweetComposeViewController#setInitialText' method on iOS 5.1 or below
    would trigger a crash at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug in Pointer#cast! where symbol arguments could not be given to.
  * Fixed a bug where methods that take variable arguments do not call
    the appropriate function if an ArgumentError exception if raised.
  * Fixed a bug where calling super from a #define_method block would fail.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler when compiling references to C constants which
    might already exist in the kernel module (ex. kCFBooleanTrue).
  * Fixed a bug when starting the simulator with the 'retina=true' option.
    Thanks to Scott Pierce for the patch.
  * Fixed the build system to build vendored Xcode projects into the `.build'
    directory instead of `build', as some projects come with such a directory.
  * Fixed a memory bug when calling `File.open' with a splat Array argument.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.21 which prevented the OCMock framework
    to work, because the dispatcher was performing one additional selector on
    NSProxy-based receivers and OCMock counts the number of messages.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake spec' where the simulator launcher would exit with an
    error status even if the spec suite was successful.
  * Improved Hash#[]= performance when an Array is used for key to use a
    MurmurHash function instead of hashing on the length. 400 times faster.
  * Added the Pointer#value method which is alias for Pointer#[0].
  * Added the `app.framework_search_paths' variable that lets you configure
    the custom framework paths for the project build.
  * Added the `RUBYMOTION_VERSION' Ruby constant at runtime which points to the
    version of RubyMotion, as a String. Cleaned up other RUBY_ constants.
  * Added the `spec:device' Rake task which will run the spec/test suite on the
    device via the debugger.

= RubyMotion 1.25 =

  * Fixed a bug when using Objective-C properties implemented using message
    forwarding (ex. GKMatchRequest's maxPlayers).
  * Fixed a bug in build system where the app.info_plist dictionary would not
    be re-generated if app.info_plist is called before changing other settings
    (ex. app.name).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where vendored Xcode projects (including
    projects via CocoaPods) would not be built honoring the Rakefile
    app.deployment_target variable.
  * Fixed a bug in the `rake device' debugger task where the debugger would
    fail to attach if the application name includes a space character.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where a project whose path includes a space
    character would fail to build the second time.
  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where methods defined with `define_method' that
    are either aliased or created via a module inclusion would crash when
    called at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the `get-task-allow' entitlement
    which is set to true by default could not be set to false. Thanks to
    @andreas for the patch.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where a stty-related warning would be
    printed in case the task is launched from a process where stdout is not a
    tty. Thanks to Dennis Ushakov for the patch.
  * Fixed a bug in Range's evaluation order, where the beginning part would not
    be evaluated at first (ex. (x = 0)..(x + 1)).
  * Improved the Regexp class to support octal literals and '\[hH]' matchers.
  * Fixed Math.atan2 to follow the Ruby 1.9.3 specs when both arguments are 0.0.

= RubyMotion 1.24 =

  * Added support for the GM version of the iOS 6 SDK.
  * Added support for the iPhone5 architecture (armv7s).
  * Added new values for the `retina' option of `rake simulator': `3.5' (for
    iPhone4) and `4' (for iPhone5). A `true' value will default to `3.5' in
    case the simulator target is lesser than 6.0, otherwise, `4' will be used.
  * Added debugging support (experimental) for both simulator and device.
    Simply set the `debug' parameter to any value to attach the debugger
    (ex. `rake debug=1' for simulator and `rake device debug=1' for device).
    The Ruby code compiles with relevant DWARF metadata and the debugger
    used is gdb. Note that the debugger experience is a work in progress and
    will be significantly improved in future releases.
    Check out http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/articles/debugging
  * Fixed the `development' mode to not compile with LLVM optimizations. This
    results in faster compilation times and also better debugging support,
    but the code might run a bit slower. The `release' mode builds with the
    entire optimization passes.
  * Added to the build system the `mode' option which can be used to specify
    the build mode, either `development' (default) or `release'. You can now
    test your app in release mode by using `rake mode=release' for simulator
    and `rake device mode=release' for device.
  * Fixed the build system not to execute the user-defined application setup
    block twice, which is no longer necessary with the new `mode' option.
  * Removed the `archive:development' and `archive:release' tasks which are
    no longer necessary with the new `mode' option.
  * Added the `archive:distribution' task which builds an .ipa with distribution
    settings (certificate, default entitlements, symbols stripped).
  * Fixed `rake spec' to produce an .app bundle that uses a different bundle
    identifier than the regular app. This is necessary in Xcode 4.5 to avoid
    simulator installation issues.
  * Fixed a bug in the simulator launcher when output to stdout would not be
    displayed in case the rake process was piped to another process
    (ex. `rake spec | ...').
  * Added the Dispatch.once method, which wraps the dispatch_once() function,
    that can be useful to implement singletons. Usage: Dispatch.once { ... }.
  * Added support for `define_method'. Like `attr_*', it cannot be used to
    overwrite existing Objective-C methods due to limitations of the compiler.
  * Fixed a bug when converting Bignum objects into 'long long' types.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where relative source paths pointing to the
    parent directory would not properly be expanded and would trigger build
    failures.
  * Fixed several bugs in String#% related to arguments and precision format.
  * Improved String#[]= performance. 50 times faster.
  * Improved String#length performance with multibyte characters. If String
    includes multibyte characters, its length will be cached and reused.
    500 times faster.
  * Improved String#reverse performance with ASCII-compatible string. 30 times
    faster.
  * Improved Fixnum/Float modulo performance. 2 times faster.
  * Fixed memory leaks in String#{reverse, reverse!}
  * Fixed a bug when calling a method on an uninitialized Regexp object.
    (ex. Regexp.allocate.to_s).
  * Fixed a bug when calling NSArray#flatten(level) with 0.
  * Fixed bugs in NSArray#rindex, NSArray#values_at, NSArray#values_at,
    NSDictionary#values_at and Kernel.#sprintf which could raise uncatchable
    exceptions.
  * Fixed a bug in Dispatch::Source.timer which couldn't handle the
    Dispatch::TIME_FOREVER constant for interval.
  * Fixed a bug in NSArray#delete_if where nil could not be returned if the
    receiver did not change.
  * Added the following methods: NSArray#rotate, NSMutableArray#rotate!,
    NSMutableArray#sort_by!, NSMutableArray#select!, NSMutableArray#keep_if,
    NSMutableDictionary#select!, NSMutableDictionary#keep_if.

= RubyMotion 1.23 =

  * Fixed a bug where conformsToProtocol: would not return true on objects
    implemented in Ruby for protocols using required/optional sections (ex.
    AQGridView).
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler metadata file for the CMSampleBufferRef type
    which would prevent methods accepting this type to be called.
  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where certain classes (ex. Random) would create
    instances released twice, triggering malloc errors later on. Thanks to
    Hugues Lismonde for the detective work.
  * Changed `rake device' to honor the `id' environment variable that can be
    used to specify the ID of the device where the app should be installed.
    This is useful when you have several iOS devices connected on your machine
    and don't want `rake device' to deploy to the first one.
  * Fixed a bug in String#strip where certain multibyte characters would be
    considered as whitespace. Thanks to Watson for the patch.
  * Fixed vendor_project (:static) to create static libraries with an object-
    file index, which is mandatory as of Mountain Lion.
  * Fixed the build system to support nested directories containing xib and
    storyboard files. Patch by Mike Kelley.
  * Fixed a bug in the `tap' method of the `spec/ui' library to properly handle
    the `at' option. Patch by Clay Allsopp and Marc Schwieterman.
  * Added the RuntimeError#nsexception method which, in case the exception
    comes from an Objective-C method, contains the original NSException object.
    This can be useful when you need to access specific NSException-level
    information (such as the `userInfo' dictionary).
  * Fixed a bug where the REPL methods (ex. `sessions') were added on the
    Kernel module, making them available to all objects. This was causing
    collisions (ex. when creating a CoreData `Session' entity).
  * Fixed the build system to pass -fobjc-arc to the linker in case the app
    is built for the 4.3 deployment target. This is necessary so that the ARC
    runtime is properly linked into the app, when vendoring 3rd-party projects
    that are ARC-only (ex. SVPullToRefresh). Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed the build system to no longer re-build all .rb files in case the
    project's Rakefile changed.

= RubyMotion 1.22 =

  * This release adds support for iOS 4.3 and 5.0 back which wasn't present in
    1.21 due to a bug in the build system. Sorry folks!

= RubyMotion 1.21 =

  * Fixed a regression in the BridgeSupport generator in Mountain Lion where
    APIs dealing with CFTypeRef would accept or return Pointer objects instead
    of genuine objects.
  * Fixed a bug where C structures starting with a lower-case character could
    potentially be registered more than once in the runtime, leading to weird
    memory issues (ex. many cocos2d structures).
  * Fixed a bug where certain bignums (ex. ALAssetsGroupAll) could not be
    passed as `unsigned int' arguments.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake static' where the static archives would not be created
    with an object-file index, which is now mandatory in Mountain Lion.
  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where Objective-C properties implemented using
    message forwarding could not be called (ex. GKPlayer's alias or playerID).

= RubyMotion 1.20 =

  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where apps compiled for iOS5 calling into APIs
    using certain C typedefs would raise an exception in iOS6 because of an
    ABI incompatibility (introduced by clang's new enumerator_attributes
    extension).
  * Fixed a bug in the runtime where an exception would occur when Objective-C
    code would try to allocate a new instance of a class defined in Ruby using
    the +new method (ex. RestKit).
  * Fixed a memory bug in Hash.[] when a Hash was passed (ex. Hash[a:'a']).
  * Fixed a bug in certain Dispatch APIs when the main Dispatch::Queue object
    was passed causing an ArgumentError exception.
  * Fixed a bug in #public_send where an exception would not be raised if the
    method is marked private.
  * Fixed a bug when preparing blocks for libdispatch where dynamic variables
    could be prematurely collected.
  * Fixed a bug when certain methods implemented using message forwarding
    would not be properly precompiled and would be raising an exception at
    runtime (ex. UITextInputTraits enablesReturnKeyAutomatically).
  * Removed a dyld warning that was printed on stderr when generating the
    backtrace of an exception (dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored
    because...). Mountain Lion only.
  * Fixed the runtime to be able to use Objective-C classes whose names start
    with a lower-case character by capitalizing the name, similar to how C
    constants and enumerations are mapped. (Ex. ICarrousel.new for the
    iCarrousel class).
  * The iOS 6.0 version of the runtime has been recompiled for iOS 6.0 Beta 3.

= RubyMotion 1.19 =

  * Fixed a compiler bug (segfault) that could happen when compiling files
    using C opaque types.

= RubyMotion 1.18 =

  * Fixed a problem introduced in 1.16 that was causing objects returned from
    certain initializers to be autoreleased twice.
  * Added the `motiondir' project variable that can be used to specify the path
    of the RubyMotion distribution (defaults to /Library/RubyMotion/lib).
    Patch by Marc Schwieterman.
  * Added support to test Storyboards in the testing layer. Patch by Marc
    Schwieterman.
  * Added the `--force-version=X' argument to `motion update' which can be used
    to downgrade to a specific version of RubyMotion. This can be useful to
    reduce bugs. Ex: motion update --force-version=1.15
  * Fixed the iOS 6.0 Rakefile to use Xcode 4.5 DP2 by default.

= RubyMotion 1.17 =

  * Removed the Bundler support as it's apparently causing issues on certain
    environments. It will be added back once we figure out the edge cases.

= RubyMotion 1.16 =

  * Fixed a compiler bug in the way certain opaque types in the CoreMIDI
    framework would not properly be handled, causing crashes at runtime.
  * Fixed a regression in the build system where spec files in nested
    directories would not be taken into account. Patch by Marc Schwieterman.
  * Bundler is now optionally required by the build system. If you use bundler,
    you do not need to require it in the project's Rakefile anymore. Patch by
    Vladimir Pouzanov.
  * Disabled exception logging when running in spec mode.
  * Fixed a bunch of memory leaks due to a bug in the compiler that was not
    properly autoreleasing objects returned from overloaded initializers.
    Thanks to Satoshi Ebisawa for the detective work.
  * Fixed a memory bug in Array that was happening when re-allocating the
    storage after a #shift call.
  * Fixed a compiler bug where C or Objective-C APIs returning 32-bit integers
    whose values cannot fix in 30-bits would not be properly converted into
    Bignum types.
  * Fixed a bug in the simulator launcher where iPad projects could be started
    in the iPad simulator but using an iPhone simulator frame.
  * The iOS 6.0 version of the runtime has been recompiled for iOS 6.0 Beta 2.

= RubyMotion 1.15 =

  * Improved the spec framework to leverage UIAutomation's functionality. This
    lets you write functional tests on views and controllers by using the same
    event generators, but in pure Ruby (and not Javascript).
    Check http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/articles/testing for more
    information about the new API. Feature contributed by Eloy Duran.
  * Introduced spec helpers. `rake spec' will now honor the files inside the
    `spec/helpers' directory (if it exists) and compile them before the spec
    files.
  * Introduced the `files' option to `rake spec', which can be used to filter
    the spec files that should be run. Filters can be either the basename of
    a spec file or its full path, and are separated by a comma.
    Example: rake spec files=main_spec,kvo_spec,spec/foo_spec.rb
  * Introduced the RUBYMOTION_ENV constant in the runtime which can have one of
    the following string values: 'test', 'development' and 'release'.
  * Introduced the `rake static' task which creates a universal static library
    containing the project's object files and the RubyMotion runtime, which is
    suitable for inclusion in Objective-C/Xcode projects.
  * Introduced weak frameworks support. The `app.weak_frameworks' setting can
    be set to an array of framework names, similar to how `app.frameworks'
    works (ex. app.weak_frameworks += ['Twitter']). Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where  files within symlinks inside of the
    resources directory would not be copied. Patch by Nick Quaranto.

= RubyMotion 1.14 =

  * Fixed a bug in the Struct class where certain instances would be released
    twice and triggering a malloc error.
  * Fixed a bug where aliasing a method generated by attr_* would trigger an
    assertion at runtime when being called.
  * Fixed a bug where calling methods generated by attr_* from Objective-C
    would return NSNull instead of nil in case the attribute is nil.
  * Fixed a bug in the random number generator where the generator would not be
    properly initialized in certain cases (ex. Array#sample), therefore always
    returning the same values.
  * Fixed a bug where using C structures containing bitfields (ex. NSDecimal)
    would trigger an exception at compilation time.
  * Added support for pointers to C strings (needed for glShaderSource()).
    Usage: Pointer.new(:string, n) where n is the number of C strings, then
    simply assign Ruby strings with #[]=.
  * Changed the runtime to log all raised exceptions via NSLog(). This behavior
    can be controlled via the Exception.log_exceptions variable (which is true
    by default, but can be set to false).
  * Introduced new project variables: short_version, background_modes and
    status_bar_style. Patch by Francis Chong.

= RubyMotion 1.13 =

  * Fixed a regression in `rake simulator' introduced by the last update.
    Also, the environment variable used to set the SDK target is renamed to
    `target' (ex. rake target=4.3).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where certain .rb files would be rebuilt
    every time `rake build' was executed, because the object directory was not
    touched.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the RUBYOPT variable would not be
    cleared when calling the gen_bridge_metadata tool, which would cause some
    issues later on. Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.

= RubyMotion 1.12 =

  * Fixed a bug where sending an `init' message alone (without using `alloc'
    before) would lead to a memory crash. This was possible when overloading
    an initWith* method and doing `self.init' inside.
  * Fixed a bug where performing Objective-C methods that accept CFType objects
    would crash the program (ex. [ABPersonViewController setDisplayedPerson:]).
  * Switched to clang++ to link the executable bits. This fixes linker crashes
    on iOS 6.0.
  * Added `fast' output for `rake spec'. Fixed a bug in the other outputs.
    Patch by Marin Usalj.
  * Improved the build system to let the user specify CPU archs that should be
    used for a certain platform. The `app.archs' method returns a Hash that one
    can tweak. This is so far only useful when you target 4.3 (which is armv6
    and armv7) and want to link with a 3rd-party library that only supports
    armv7 (ex. app.archs['iPhoneOS'] = ['armv7']).
  * Improved `rake simulator' to honor the `deployment_target' environment
    variable (ex. rake deployment_target=4.3). Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the compiler would not use the right
    BridgeSupport files when using a lower deployment_target.
    Patch by Satoshi Ebisawa.
  * Fixed the build system to re-link the .app executable in case one of the
    vendored libraries changed.
  * Fixed bugs in both ARM/simulator compilers where structures smaller than
    64 bits would not be following the ABI and causing unexpected behavior in
    certain cases (ex. cocos2d). Thanks to Aaron Hurley for the detective work.
  * Removed Kernel#select as it clashes with a private `select' method defined
    by iOS and triggered when hitting the select button in a paste action.
    Thanks to Francis Chong for the detective work.

= RubyMotion 1.11 =

  * Fixed a bug where the runtime would not allow `nil' to be passed as a
    C-level block argument.
  * Fixed a bug where methods defined by attr_* would abort the program when
    called by Objective-C.
  * Improved `rake spec' to honor the `output' environment variable, which can
    be used to select a different output format. Available formats: spec_dox,
    test_unit, tap and knock (ex. rake spec output=test_unit).
  * Support for the iOS 6.0 Beta 1 SDK can be generated after having installed
    Xcode 4.5 by typing the following command:
    $ cd /Library/RubyMotion/data/6.0; rake update

= RubyMotion 1.10 =

  * Fixed the build system to validate the content of the `app.icons' variable,
    since a wrong value may trigger an "unrecognized selector" exception in
    Application Loader when trying to submit the app to the App Store.
  * Fixed the Rakefile created by `motion create' to include the magic utf8
    comment, as the file may contain multibyte characters and be parsed by
    Ruby 1.9. Patch by @pchw.
  * Fixed a memory bug when using symbols as Hash keys.
  * Exposed iOS 4.3 (or greater) libdispatch APIs.
  * The following NSString methods that used to raise a "does not work on
    NSStrings" exception are no longer defined: byte_size, get_byte, set_byte,
    force_encoding, valid_encoding?, ascii_only?, bytes, each_byte, to_data,
    pointer. This allows the developer to use respond_to?. These methods
    however are available on strings created in Ruby.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where the value of `deployment_target'
    would be used as the SDK version, causing a `system_root != nil' assertion
    in some cases.
  * Fixed the compilation of empty symbols (:'').
  * Fixed the generation of .bridgesupport files on Snow Leopard by not
    passing the '--no-64-bit' flag (which was added in Lion).
  * Fixed `motion create' to accept dash or underscore characters in the app
    name. Patch by Mark Villacampa.
  * Added a workaround for an iOS 5.1 bug that causes write(2) to return EBADF
    when writing to stdout. The bug seems to happen on devices not configured
    for development. Writing to stdout (using p/puts) in this scenario becomes
    a no-op.
  * Fixed the simulator launcher to properly propagate exit(2) status codes
    from the simulated app. This fixes `rake spec' to properly exit with 1 in
    case one or more specs failed to run.
  * Fixed the RUBY_ENGINE constant to be 'rubymotion' (was 'macruby' before).
  * Objective-C objects conforming to the NSFastEnumeration protocol can now be
    iterated using the #each method. The method is created on demand on these
    objects.
  * Fixed a bug in the simulator REPL where hitting the Home button would
    trigger an insane CPU usage.

= RubyMotion 1.9 =

  * Fixed a bug in the build system where the paths of vendored libraries
    would not be properly quoted and cause a build failure in case they
    contain space characters.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where using a lower deployment_target
    version would cause a link error at runtime because the application was
    linking against a framework that does not exist (ex. CoreImage on 4.3).
  * Fixed the `rake spec' task to not move the simulator window to the
    foreground.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where APIs accepting pointers to
    CoreFoundation types could not be given Pointer objects of the :object
    type (ex. CFErrorRef*).
  * Added support for CoreAudio (experimental). At the very least, constants
    pointing to four-bytes characters should be properly covered.
  * Fixed a typo in "expected array of %d elements, got %d" exception message
    where the numbers were inverted. Thanks Enrico Thierbach.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where compiling strings containing only null
    characters (ex. "\x00") would cause a crash.

= RubyMotion 1.8 =

  * Fixed a bug in the generation of BridgeSupport files for multiple headers
    directories.
  * When building vendored projects, unset environment variables that could
    potentially make the build to fail.
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/12

= RubyMotion 1.7 =

  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where the proper signature would not be used
    when defining informal protocol methods with CF types as arguments.
  * Fixed iOS constants to be looked up at demand (when being used) and not
    when the app starts, because certain constants are not set until a certain
    API is called (ex: the kAB... constants of the AddressBook framework).
    This change should also speed up a little bit the app starting time.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where very long selectors would be truncated
    and causing exceptions later at runtime.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where memory-related selectors (alloc, dealloc,
    retain, release, etc.) could not be defined in Ruby.
  * Fixed a bug in the compiler where NSObject instance methods could not be
    called on classes (ex. MyClass.performSelector(...)).
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where vendored 3rd-party APIs dealing with
    types defined in iOS headers could not be used (ex: enums or structs).

= RubyMotion 1.6 =

  * Fixed a regression in the build system introduced by the previous update
    (when compiling .xib files).
  * Fixed the vendoring system to include all source code files. Merged patch
    from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubymotion/tPCxSMCA2f4/w2DIHFo2AVAJ
  * Fixed the REPL to not crash if you give it an empty expression.

= RubyMotion 1.5 =

  * Improved the REPL to support multi-line expressions.
  * Fixed a bug when compiling Core Data model files where the `momc' utility
    was not given absolute paths.
  * Removed legacy MacRuby code that was using the private `isaForAutonotifying'
    selector and causing a warning during an App Store submission.
  * Fixed a bug in Enumerable#sort_by that would lead to a crash.
  * Fixed a bug in the REPL where it would not detect the iOS Simulator window
    if certain windows were in front or created later.
  * Fixed a bug in the build system where framework dependencies would not be
    properly handled.
  * Added support for .lproj directories (i18n). Thanks Aaron Hurley.
  * Fixed a bug where objects from pure Ruby classes sent to KVO would not be
    properly handled later (because KVO inserts a new singleton class).
  * Fixed attr_writer to emit KVO notifications (will/didChangeValueForKey).

= RubyMotion 1.4 =

  * Added support for the compilation of .xcdatamodeld and .storyboard resource
    files. Thanks Ian Phillips, Andrew Vega and Michail Pishchagin.
  * Fixed a bug when the build system would fail in case the resources dir does
    not exist. Thanks Watson.
  * Fixed a bug in the Xcode project vendoring code when header files at
    different directory levels would not be properly handled. This also fixes
    the motion-cocoapods gem. Thanks Eloy Duran.
  * Added a way to start the simulator in retina mode by setting the `retina'
    environment variable to `true' (other values will be considered false).
    For example: `rake retina=true'. Thanks Marcin Maciukiewicz for the idea.
  * Fixed an ABI bug in the way we compile Ruby methods overloading Objective-C
    methods returning small C structures that can fit in a 64-bit integer.
    Thanks Kristoph Cichocki-Romanov for the report.
  * Added support for the iOS 4.3 SDK.

= RubyMotion 1.3 =

  * Fixed a bug in format strings with width / precision modifiers.
  * Disabled the automatic loading of motion- gems.
  * Added support for the compilation of Interface Builder resource files.
    .xib files present in the `resources' directory will be compiled to .nib
    files then copied in the app bundle. .nib files are added to the default
    .gitignore and removed during `rake clean'. Thanks Ian Phillips.
  * Improved the `rake device' error message to mention that Wi-Fi sync might
    cause device deployments to fail.
  * Fixed a bug in NSArray#reject where the new array would not be returned.

= RubyMotion 1.2 =

  * Fixed a couple bugs in the project vendoring code that would be triggered
    when using the motion-cocoapods gem. The fixes were merged from the
    https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods/issues/1 discussion.
  * Fixed codesign bugs in `rake archive:release'.
  * Improved the Xcode detection code by printing a warning message in case
    the user installed a recent Xcode in /Applications that has not been
    set as the default Xcode in the system yet.
  * Fixed a typo in the REPL help message (thanks Mike Clark).

= RubyMotion 1.1 =

  * Fixed `rake device' to print a human-readable error message in case the
    deployment might fail because another process is connected to the device.
  * Fixed a bug in `rake simulator' where view detection would not work on
    non-English desktops (error "Cannot locate the Simulator app").
    Make sure to exit the Simulator app after applying this update.

= RubyMotion 1.0 =

  * First release.
